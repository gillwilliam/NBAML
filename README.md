# NBA ML
1. To predict how much the value (current market salary) of a basketball player
2. Predict the 2018-19 MVP

## Tools
- Tensorflow
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- NBA-API

## Current Build
- Performs a multi feature linear regression on n features
- Displays a graph of the cost curve vs the number of iterations
- Uses a RandomForestClassifier in sklearn to determine the 2018-19 MVP

## MVP Results (so far)
- The current prediction is that Giannis Antetokounmpo will be the MVP with about 77% confidence


## TODO
- Integrate data with regression
- Better Integrate the feature scaling
