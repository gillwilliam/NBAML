# Transfer Fee Predictor
To predict how much the transfer fee for a player would be

## Tools
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib

## Current Build
- Performs a multi feature linear regression on 2 features
- Displays a graph of the cost curve vs the number of iterations

## TODO
- Make the code more modular to accept (n) features from the csv
- Get the data for players that have been transferred over the past year
- Get player data for players that haven't been transferred to predict what they are worth
